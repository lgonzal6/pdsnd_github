### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare

### Description
Explore US Bikeshare is an interactive program, developed with python. The program allows users to explore bikeshare data from three cities (Chicago, Washington, and New York City) that covers the first six months of 2017. Users are first prompted to choose which city data they would like to explore. Then users can choose whether they would like to filter the further by month or day of the week. After the data is filtered, users are given the option to display the raw data. Subsequently, the program will display description statistics.
